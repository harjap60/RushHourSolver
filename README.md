1. Upload of my first year project where I created a program to solve puzzles for a game called Rush Hour.
2. The goal of this game is to get the red car(car X in my test cases) to the other side of the board.
3. This program solves the puzzle in the shortest number of moves and does so efficiently.
4. It takes in .txt puzzles and logs each move into .sol files. Repo contains examples with 36 puzzles and 36 solutions.
5. Cars can be any length but can only move the direction they are facing. So either vertical or horizontal.
